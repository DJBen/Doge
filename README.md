It changes any faces to DOGES!!! A perfect demo of iOS face detection API.

Much more handsome than before! Isn't it?

## TODO
1. More DOGE faces with different styles. SUCH CUTE!
2. A toolbar that allows micro-adjustments to doges (rotation, translation, etc).
3. A toolset to add comment of comic sans font.
